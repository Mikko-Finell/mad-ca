Check the target goals in `rules_specification.md` and `roadmap.md` before you make any changes.

Update the file `roadmap.md` after making changes to the code in this sim. Mark item status as 'Not started|In progress|Complete'. If you left a phase as 'In progress' you should add a note of what you worked on and a suggested next task, so contributors can easily pick up and continue.
