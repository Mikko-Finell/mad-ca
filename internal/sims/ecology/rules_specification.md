# ðŸŒ‹ Cellular Automata Ecology Simulation

### Version 1.1 â€” Regional Events Edition

## 1. Overview

This 2-D cellular automaton models the evolution of an **ecological-geological landscape**: vegetation growth, forest fires, volcanic activity, and rainfall.
It is not meant as a pure mathematical automaton but as a simulation-style system whose rules yield plausible terrain cycles: grasslands spreading, forests forming, volcanoes erupting, lava cooling, and regrowth after disturbance.

| Layer               | States               | Notes                             |          |       |                        |

## 3. Environmental Fields

Optional continuous maps influencing probabilities:

| Field               | Range | Role                                     |
| ------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `tectonic_map[x,y]` | 0â€“1   | drives mountain uplift & volcano seeding |
| `RainMask[x,y]`     | 0â€“1   | produced by regional rain events         |
| `VolcanoMask[x,y]`  | 0â€“1   | produced by proto-volcano regions        |

---

## 4. Region Events

### 4.1 Concept

A **RegionEvent** defines an area-scale temporary influence.

```
kind: "Rain" | "VolcanoProto"
cx, cy : float
r       : float
falloff : "gaussian" | "linear" | "flat"
strength: float  (0â€“1)
ttl     : int    // ticks remaining
noiseSeed: int   // for irregular edges
```

Each tick, events rasterize into their masks; when `ttl==0` they expire.

---

### 4.2 Rain Regions

* Spawn 0â€“2 new regions per tick (cap â‰ˆ4 active). Spawn is suppressed when existing clouds already cover >15% of the map.
* Each region spans radius 16â€“40 tiles (anisotropic variants stretch axes) and lasts 12â€“30 ticks by default. Squall presets use 8â€“15 ticks.
* Mask geometry combines a **soft noise gate** with smooth radial falloff: `R(x,y) = clamp(smoothstep(Ï„-Î”, Ï„+Î”, fbm((x,y))) * smoothstep(0,1,1-(d/R)^p) * strength, 0,1)` with `pâ‰ˆ1.3â€“1.5`, `Ï„â‰ˆ0.35â€“0.45`, `Î”â‰ˆ0.08`, and per-region noise seeds. Radii inside `d/R < 0.35` are forced to full opacity before the falloff so cloud cores never punch through. Small specks are removed with a 2px morphological closing pass.
* Regions drift each tick using a low-frequency wind field plus light jitter; strength eases in/out (~Â±15%). Overlapping clouds (>20% shared area) are merged by max-blending and the larger cloud absorbs the smaller (strength +0.1, capped at 1.0).
* Presets provide variety: puffy (round), stratus (flattened band, stretched noise), and squall (elongated major axis, faster drift).

**Effects (sample R = RainMask[x,y]):**

| Rule               | Multiplier         |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Lava cooling bonus | `+8 Ã— R` per tick  |
| Ignite/spread prob | `Ã— (1 âˆ’ 0.75 Ã— R)` |
| Extinguish chance  | `0.5 Ã— R`          |

Rain thus cools lava and damps fires smoothly across its gradient.

### 4.3 Volcano Proto Regions

Volcano formation is a **two-phase process**.

#### Phase A â€“ Proto (uplift)

* Spawn region where tectonic_map is high.
* Radius 10â€“22, lifetime 10â€“25 ticks, nearly flat falloff with slight jitter.
* Each tick: if `ground==Rock` and random < `2Ã—P_uplift_baseÃ—V`, convert to `Mountain`.
* Uplift probability may peak near the rim to form a caldera.

#### Phase B â€“ Eruption

When proto expires:

* Compute mean mask value VÌ„.
* With chance `P_erupt_baseÃ—VÌ„`, erupt:

  * **Core** (`r < 0.35R`): `ground = Lava`, random lava_life.
  * **Rim** (`0.35Râ€“0.9R`): convert Rockâ†’Mountain.
  * **Specks:** small random lava spots on rim.
* If not erupted â†’ region vanishes quietly.

---

## 5. Ground-Layer Rules

- **Uplift** converts `Rock` â†’ `Mountain` using the tectonic mask, unchanged from prior revisions.
- **Eruptions** now seed a caldera of flowing lava: the core (â‰ˆ35% of the radius) becomes `GroundLava` with thickness `h=2â€“3` and temperature `T=1`, the rim converts to `Mountain`, and 1â€“3 vents are created for 20â€“40 ticks that inject one unit of lava per tick into the downhill direction.
- Each lava cell tracks `hâˆˆ[0,7]`, `Tâˆˆ[0,1]`, an optional heading `dir`, a `tip` flag, a static pseudo-elevation `elev`, and a persistent `channel` weight that biases future flow.
- **Tip advection** evaluates candidate neighbors (forward, Â±45Â°, and any downhill choices) with the score `wSlopeÂ·Î”elev + wAlignÂ·dot(dir) + wChanÂ·channel âˆ’ wRainÂ·RainMask âˆ’ wWallÂ·uphillPenalty`. Tips advance when the best score clears the threshold, optionally splitting when the trunk is thick. Forced advances ignore the alignment term once the trunk overflows (`hâ‰¥4`).
- **Pooling** occurs when a tip cannot advance: the trunk thickens, a low-elevation neighbor may fill with a shallow pool, and once overflowed the next tick will force an advance.
- **Cooling & crusting** subtract `Î”T = 0.02 + edgeÂ·0.03 + rainÂ·0.08 + sigmoid(hâˆ’2)Â·0.02`, with an extra 0.02 for pools. When `Tâ‰¤0.15` thick flows crust (`h--`, `T` capped at 0.35); otherwise the tile solidifies to `GroundRock`.
- **Channel reinforcement** raises `channel += 0.15` for cells that advanced in the tick, then decays the field by 0.5% globally to keep rivers coherent without permanent grooves.
- Rain cools lava faster and penalizes forward scores, encouraging early pooling and crusting under storms.

## 6. Fire Rules

| Stage                  | Logic                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ignition from Lava** | Vegetation near Lava ignites with `0.8 Ã— (1âˆ’0.75R)`     |
| **Fire Spread**        | Burning neighbor ignites others with `0.25 Ã— (1âˆ’0.75R)` |
| **Burn-Down**          | After 3 ticks, vegetationâ†’None                          |
| **Rain Extinguish**    | `rand()<0.5R` â†’ clear Burning                           |

---

## 7. Vegetation Rules

Executed top-down so a tile only advances one stage per tick.

| Transition  | Condition          | Probability |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Shrubâ†’Tree  | â‰¥3 Shrub neighbors | 0.02        |
| Grassâ†’Shrub | â‰¥3 Grass neighbors | 0.04        |
| Dirtâ†’Grass  | any Grass neighbor | 0.25        |

Fire or lava remove vegetation; thereâ€™s no passive withering.

---

## 8. Tick Sequence (Pseudo)

```pseudo
tick():
  RainMask.clear(); VolcanoMask.clear()

  // 1. Rasterize regions
  for e in regions:
    mask = (e.kind==Rain)?RainMask:VolcanoMask
    rasterizeRoundish(e, mask)
    e.ttl -= 1

  // 2. Volcano proto uplift & eruptions
  applyUplift(VolcanoMask)
  eruptExpiredProtos(VolcanoMask)

  // 3. Lava spread & cooling (uses RainMask)
  updateLava()

  // 4. Fire (uses RainMask)
  updateFire()

  // 5. Vegetation
  updateVegetation()

  // 6. Cleanup & spawn new regions
  removeExpiredRegions()
  maybeSpawnRain()
  maybeSpawnVolcanoProto()
```

---

## 9. Initialization

* Start ground as **Dirt**, sprinkle **Rock** clusters.
* Generate static `tectonic_map` with noisy gradients or ridges.
* Seed a few **Grass** patches.
* Begin with no active regions.

---

## 10. Implementation Notes

* Use **double buffering** for both layers.
* Store per-cell lava thickness (`h`), temperature (`T`), heading (`dir`), tip flags, overflow markers, and a float channel memory alongside the burn TTL field.
* Cache the pseudo-elevation raster per eruption so tip scoring stays local and cheap.
* Evaluate probabilities in random or shuffled order to reduce bias.
* Keep region count small; rasterization is cheap when few regions exist.
* For visuals, color by `ground` then overlay vegetation and burning glow.

---

### Summary

This version forms a closed ecological loop:

1. **Grasslands** expand â†’ **Shrubs** â†’ **Forests**.
2. **Volcano protoregions** uplift mountains and occasionally **erupt**.
3. **Lava** spreads, burns vegetation, **cools to rock**, restoring substrate.
4. **Rain regions** drift across the map, damping fires and hastening cooling.
5. Over many ticks, the map cycles through **growth, destruction, and renewal**, generating an emergent, believable terrain ecology.
